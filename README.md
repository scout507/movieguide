# Movie Guide (WBS Project)

Author: Dominik MÃ¼nch

The App can be found [here.](https://movieguide.herokuapp.com/)



##  Description

Movie Guide is a Mashup-App, that uses serveral REST-API's to provide you with interesting infomation about the movies you enjoy. The information presented includes:



- Genre, Imbd-rating, length
- Short summary
- A Wiki-article
- Information about the cast and the option to read up their Wiki-info
- NYT review
- A recomandation of movies with similar genre or cast



Upon loading the site for the first time, you are presented a search-bar. Once you search for a movie a new section will show up which contains the requested information. If you hover the movie poster it will flip over and present you information from Wikipedia. You could also scroll down to see recommended movies or click on one of the cast members name to open up some more information about them. This will change the recommended section to movies this person has been part of.



## API's

The API's used on this website are provided by:

- [TMBd](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) (for the search algorithm, images, cast, plot and the recommended section)
- [OMDb](http://www.omdbapi.com/) (for minor information like rating, genre length etc.)
- [NYT-API](https://developer.nytimes.com/)
- [Wikipedia-API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page)

The API provided by TMDb is very powerful and allows for a vast variety of different GET-Requests that provide all the information you need. When working with TMDb you will need to start by their search-requests to get you their internal ID for the movie/actor you wish to get information on.




## Color-Design

For the color-design I used [Google's Material Design Color System](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-usage-and-palettes). Since this app is using a lot of different mostly colorfull images I didn't want to push things too far by using bright colors in the design. I also figured that most people would search for movies in the evening/night time, so I settled for a nice, relaxing grey tone as my primary color: `#212529`. From there, I choose my secondary color, `#fec503`, because it realy pops out in front of the darker primary color, while still not beeing overpowering to the eye.

After deciding on these two colors I used the tool to get some darker and brighter tones for things like highlights on hovering links etc.

I also used some variance of white and black, again because the pictures used are very colorfull to begin with, but since my primary color is grey, they're basicly just some brighter and darker version of my primary color.
